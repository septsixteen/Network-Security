    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to write a zip file extractor and password cracker. We will use the zipfile library. You may use the extractall( ) method to extract the contents from a zip file.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    1) Write a quick script to test the use of the zipfile library. After importing the library, instantiate a new ZipFile class by specifying the filename of the password-protected zip file (evil.zip). utilize the extractall( ) method and specify the optional parameter for the password (secret). \n",
    "    \n",
    "    2) Use the except Exception exception handler to catch exceptions and print them out when an incorrect password is used. Execute your script with an incorrect password and exception handler and turn in the code and output.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3) Write a script that performs a dictionary attack on the password protected zip file. Execute your script and turn in the code and output. Be sure to provide user feedback on exceptions thrown.\n"
