    "## Background\n",
    "    - UNIX stores all passwords in the file /etc/passwd. Well, it doesn’t store the password itself. Instead, it stores a signature of the password by using the password to encrypt a block of zero bits prepended by a salt value with a one-way function called crypt( ). The result of the crypt( ) function is stored in the /etc/passwd file. For example, for a password of “egg” and salt equal to “HX”, the function crypt(‘egg’,‘HX’) returns HX9LLTdc/jiDE.\n",
    "    - When you try to log in, the program /bin/login takes the password that you typed, uses crypt( ) to encrypt a block of zero bits, and compares the result of this function with the value stored in the /etc/passwd file.\n",
    "    - The security of this approach rests on both the strength of the crypt( ) function and the difficulty in guessing a user’s password. The crypt( ) algorithm has proven to be highly resistant to attacks. Conversely, the user’s choices for passwords have been found to be relatively easy to guess, with many passwords being words contained in the dictionary."

    "## The Original Unix crypt Password Mechanism: [1]\n",
    "-\tRead the first eight characters of the password (the rest is ignored).  If a shorter password is used, pad with zeros.   Using 7-bit ASCII results in a 56 bit partial key.\n",
    "-\tNext a 12 bit random value is chosen and encoded to form a salt, which has two character string from the ASCII letters and digits. Often the current time is used to generate the salt.\n",
    "-\t The salt is added to the partial key to generate the longer key that is used with DES encryption.\n",
    "-\t A message (a string of eight bytes initialized to all zeros) is then encrypted with DES using the key.  This results in 64 bits (eight bytes) of encrypted output.\n",
    "-\tThe encrypted output is used as the input message (in place of the zeros) and the encryption is repeated, for a total of 25 DES encryption cycles.  (Although DES encryption is used, the original message is known and thus this is more of a hash of the password than an encryption of the all zero message.)\n",
    "-\t The 64 bit result is then encoded to be all printable characters (letters and digits and periods only) that results in an 11 character ASCII string.\n",
    "-\tThe 2-character salt plus the 11 character encrypted text is stored in the password file.\n",
    "-\tTo validate a user's password, the entered password plus the retrieved salt value is used to generate the 11character result.  This result is compared, byte for byte, with the copy in the password file.\n",

    "\n",
    "A simple dictionary attack involves computing the possible signatures generated for each word in the dictionary with a range of salt values. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - We will need to use the crypt( ) algorithm, the crypt library, that hashes UNIX passwords. Note that the crypt library already exists in the Python 2.79 standard library (on UNIX-based operating systems). (Note: for Windows- based operating systems, you will need to find the correct way to import the UNIX crypt() algorithm.) \n",
    "    - To calculate the encrypted UNIX password signature, we simply call the function crypt.cypt( ) and pass it the password and salt as parameters. This function returns the signature as a string. \n",
    "    - Start your program by reading in the passwords.txt file and, for each password found in the file, iterate through each dictionary word found in the dictionary.txt file and appropriate salt value.\n",
    "    - Report out the password found, if any, for each user. If no password is found, indicate that no password was found. 2) Using literature review, identify from where you can retrieve the salt value used in generating the signature.\n"
